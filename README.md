This project presents a comprehensive web-based waste collection system designed to optimize routes, improve field staff accountability, and empower citizens and health officers through intuitive tools and data visibility. The system replaces QR-only logic with GPS-driven route mapping, a multi-role interface, and a lightweight frontend app architecture that does not require server infrastructure for basic functionality.

1. Worker Module (Route Collector Interface)
- Route Selection: Workers select themselves from a dropdown and view their assigned stops.
- Map-Based Visualization: Uses Google Maps API to render location markers for each house on the route.
- Route Polyline Display: Automatically connects all stops via an optimized path on the map.
- Tap-to-Collect (Extendable): Each listed house can support a collection confirmation button and time logger.
- GPS Ping Support (Extendable): Logs current GPS coordinates when route is activated (can be saved for auditing).
  
Benefits: Simple UI for low-literate workers, no QR dependence, no mobile app install required.

2. Citizen Companion View
- House ID Search: Citizens enter their house ID to check whether waste was collected that day.
- Collection Status Feedback: Shows visual confirmation (✅ or ❌) with optional reward or badge logic.
- Future Scope: SMS alert trigger, monthly report, or feedback form.
  
Benefits: Encourages citizen participation and trust in the system without needing them to install an app.


3. Health Officer Dashboard
- Ward-Wise Coverage Summary: Tabular view showing number of houses, collection percentage, missed stops.
- Scalable Data Feed: Simulates loading data from CSVs or Google Sheets.
- Future Scope: Performance heatmaps, anomaly flagging, or route playback support.
  
Benefits: Enables real-time monitoring of daily progress, exception handling, and transparent reporting.
